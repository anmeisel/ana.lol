Challenging The Museum. Questioning and expanding the traditionalist display and customary position and platform of the science museum. We tackled this by using: - The body of the visitor as the exhibition itself. - An absorbing commodity created by humans as a vehicle to explore the world and to tell a story about environmental conditions through time and location. - This as a link between our bodies and our landscape. - The artefact as a thing a visitor can consume instead of just observing."></div>

- Can we see what a locally produced beer in Oxford Street would taste like versus a beer in Greenwich?
- What happens to our bodies, and why does this happen?

our interest in beer sprung from the universal popularity and mass consumption in the young adult demographic. finding out about the craft artistry, raw material integration, and social impact on beer, we decided to pursue the belief in beer being a highly complex influence on, and outcome of, nature and its relationship with humans. perceive beer as a scientific apparatus to explore the world."></div>

going into the idea of using beer as a tool to explore our surrounding, e started to study beer as a way of looking at ourselves."></div>

ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex: these parts have connections that make ip the brain’s reward system and regulate impulsive behaviour, making drinkers more confident with their actions. This is also the part of the brain that is affected first, causing behaviour to become looser and less guarded. controls nervousness. 
reticular activating system: this part is in the midbrain, and it controls sleeping and waking. an excessing amount of alcohol can completely depress these systems, causing a person to pass out.

medulla: this part is in the hindbrain, and it controls heartbeats, breathing, and other functions. it can cause slower breathing, sleepiness, and a decrease in body temperature. during heavy drinking, these may slow or stop working altogether, endangering an individuals life. controls calmness.
frontal lobe: this section controls judgment, behaviour, and emotion. alcohol may affect emotions, leading to crying, fighting, or a desire to be close to another person. controls euphoria. 
this is a more straightforward way of investigating the chemical structure of beer and how it interferes with our bodily chemical balance. ultimately, we found ways in which viewers could test their bodies to find out how they handle alcohol, and ways in which alcohol affects their brain activity. by testing your tolerance through a weight scale, the user can study the consequences of beer consumption while the brain sensor informs the user more about their brain than the actual alcohol itself."></div>

<div id="slide" class="slide65"><img src="../pictures/bookletfinalfinal/bookletfinalfinal-page-065.jpg"width="100%"alt="weight scale.
in order to look at the relationship between our bodies and alcohol, we explored the notion of tolerance so that the audience would fully understand their body’y capability. converting the measurement on a weight scale dial to a tolerance chart, the inner ring shows us the male resistance to alcohol per weight. the measurement displays how many drinks before ones reaction time is slowed, speech is slurred, and balance is impaired."></div>

this area of the exhibition could feature a wide range of interactive installations all showing and testing alcohol’s effect on the body. this could include breathalysers and other existing ways of indicating alcohol effects.
tolerance mostly depends on: genes - wether you’re male or female. wether you’re on the drugs. wether your body is used to alcohol. and most of all - weight."></div>
<div id="slide" class="slide67"><img src="../pictures/bookletfinalfinal/bookletfinalfinal-page-067.jpg"width="100%"alt="galvanic mood brain.
wanting to improve the understanding of what alcohol does to the body, we constructed a sensory reading process, whereby the information that would be taken out of the galvanic sensor would be translated into a colour. the colour represents a different type of mood that is simulated by the activity of neurotransmitters which is effected by the alcohol. this is to refine our grasp of what exactly happens to our brain when we take one sip of an alcoholic beverage, and to find a fun and interactive way of exploring the psychological aspects of intoxication."></div>

context: the nile brewery and the rise of its economy based on merging technology and climate change.
as Uganda celebrates its golden jubilee of independence during 2012, Nile breweries is proud to be a company that has grown with the nations ups and downs. founded, in 1951, eleven years before Uganda attained independence, nile breweries limited has grown to become Uganda’s beer market leader.
in Uganda, nile breweries is the second largest brewer market share. it directly employs just 430 people, but one of the most startling facts turned up by Kapstein’s research, which focused on 2007, was that an additional 44,000 jobs depended directly or indirectly on Nile breweries activities. that represents a multiplier effect of about 100."></div>

friday: evening tasting.
the series of talks and lectures would take place in a large open space featuring a stage and tables for visitors. it would take well-known elements from pubs and bars and incorporate these into a formal lecture space. the talks will begin to explore subject matter that isn’t typically linked shedding a new light on these subjects and creating links between them."></div>
